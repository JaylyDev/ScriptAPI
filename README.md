# ScriptAPI Samples

This repository is filled with community driven script samples for Minecraft Bedrock Script API.

<hr/>

### ðŸ”´ USE `stable` not `main` ðŸ”´

**Check out the `stable` branch from here: https://github.com/JaylyDev/ScriptAPI/tree/stable**.
The `main` branch is used for script development for Minecraft Preview and may often be in a **broken** state.

## [Scripts](./scripts/)

Community driven scripts that use Script API to do all kinds of crazy stuff in Minecraft.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some scripts might use API modules that are only enabled in specific runtime environments, including:
>
> `@minecraft/server-net` and `@minecraft/server-admin`: Modules that can only be used in [Bedrock Dedicated Servers](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock).
>
> `@minecraft/vanilla-data` and `@minecraft/math`: These are external Minecraft libraries published to NPM. They are not part of Minecraft's native modules.

There are two ways to use external Minecraft libraries in behavior pack scripts:

1. **Standalone file**

   Download standalone files available from [jaylydev.github.io](https://jaylydev.github.io/scriptapi-docs/meta/cdn-links.html) for quick, small-scale projects.

2. **Bundling**

   Installing it through npm, with advanced build configurations and bundling with esbuild:

    ```bash
    npm i @minecraft/math
    npm i @minecraft/vanilla-data
    ```

Guide on bundle Minecraft Scripts with the following bundlers:

- ESBuild (Recommended): [Bundle Minecraft Scripts with ESBuild](https://jaylydev.github.io/posts/bundle-minecraft-scripts-esbuild/)
- Webpack: [Bundle Minecraft Scripts with Webpack](https://jaylydev.github.io/posts/scripts-bundle-minecraft/)
