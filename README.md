# ScriptAPI Samples

This repository is filled with community driven script samples for Minecraft Bedrock Script API.

<hr/>

### 🔴 USE `stable` not `main` 🔴

**Check out the `stable` branch from here: https://github.com/JaylyDev/ScriptAPI/tree/stable**.
The `main` branch is used for script development for Minecraft Preview and may often be in a **broken** state.

<hr/>

- ### [Scripts](./scripts/)

  Community driven scripts that use Script API to do all kinds of crazy stuff in Minecraft.

  > ⚠️ Some scripts might use API modules that are only enabled in specific runtime environments, including:
  >
  > - `@minecraft/server-net` and `@minecraft/server-admin`: Modules that can only be used in [Bedrock Dedicated Servers](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock).

- ### [Editor Extensions](./editorExtensions/)

  Community driven editor extensions samples for editing Minecraft worlds. Only available on Editor projects in [Minecraft Editor](https://github.com/mojang/minecraft-editor).

  Highly recommend checking out Mojang's [editor extension starter kit](https://github.com/Mojang/minecraft-editor-extension-starter-kit) if you're experimenting with editor API for the first time!
