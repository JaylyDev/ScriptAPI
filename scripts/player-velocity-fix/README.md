# Player.setVelocity

This package aims to create a velocity on players without the use of `Player.setVelocity` method for mojang-minecraft module version '1.0.0-beta'.

This is one of the methods to get around the `Player.setVelocity` that it will now throw an exception when called on player types in module version '1.0.0-beta' of 'mojang-minecraft' module.

This function is experimental, please improve the script by submit a pull request.
