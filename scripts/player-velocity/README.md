# Warning

This function will not work due to a breaking change to `Player.setVelocity` method in 'mojang-minecraft' module '1.0.0-beta' (Minecraft 1.19.30)

This package still works in version 0.1.0

See test javascript file for example.

# [player-velocity-fix](../player-velocity-fix/): <br/> An experimental successor to set Player velocity.

Player-velocity-fix module aims to create a velocity on players without the use of `Player.setVelocity` method for mojang-minecraft 1.0.0-beta, more info there.
