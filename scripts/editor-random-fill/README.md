# Editor Random Fill Tool

## Description

Fill random blocks in a selection via Minecraft Editor.

This script contains partial source code for editor's selection extension.

This is proof of concept, where you can use a slider to choose how many block types you want the editor to fill randomly with a click of a button.

Obviously this is still a WIP.
