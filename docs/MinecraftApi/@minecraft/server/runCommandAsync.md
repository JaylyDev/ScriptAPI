# runCommandAsync

Runs a particular command asynchronously from the context of the broader dimension.
Note that there is a maximum queue of 128 asynchronous commands that can be run in a given tick.

Usually, it executes the command in the next tick.
To run command in the same tick, you have to [delay the JS code](./system.run.md#improve-runcommandasync).

Returns a `Promise<CommandResult>` . Throws an error **synchronously** if the queue is full.
